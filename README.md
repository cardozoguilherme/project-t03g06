# LDTS_T03_G06 - FLAPPY BIRD
The game is inspired by the popular "Flappy Bird." Players control Flappy, a bird, with the goal of navigating through as many pipes as possible while collecting points. Points are earned in two ways: passing through pipes awards 1 point, and collecting coins grants 5 points. In addition to pipes and coins, there are modifiers that, when collected, increase the game’s speed for 5 seconds.

The game has no predefined end and only concludes when the player collides with an obstacle.

This project was developed by Guilherme Cardozo (up202401169@edu.fe.up.pt), Tiago Zou Yin (up202306438@edu.fe.up.pt), and Fernando Oliveira (up201005231@edu.fe.up.pt) for LTDS 2024–2025. The objective of the project was to use Git as a version control tool, use Java as an object-oriented programming language, develop unit tests using JUnit, apply SOLID principles in application development, apply design patterns to solve problems in application development, identify code smells in object-oriented code, use refactoring techniques to improve non-functional attributes and resolve code smells, apply the MVC architectural pattern in event-driven application design, and patterns of enterprise applications.

**Final project grade: 19.1**
