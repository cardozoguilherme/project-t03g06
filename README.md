# LDTS_T03_G06 - FLAPPY BIRD
The game is inspired by the popular "Flappy Bird." Players control Flappy, a bird, with the goal of navigating through as many pipes as possible while collecting points. Points are earned in two ways: passing through pipes awards 1 point, and collecting coins grants 5 points. In addition to pipes and coins, there are modifiers that, when collected, increase the game’s speed for 5 seconds.

The game has no predefined end and only concludes when the player collides with an obstacle.
